This is a simple blog site in which users can post articles. In the first attempt I got creating articles and viewing functionality to work, but then it stopped working after I tried to slugify the urls and I didn't know how to troubleshoot it. I tried starting over, on my second attempt, but ran into similar errors and dind't get as far.
